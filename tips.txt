1) For taking MOD 
    --> Dont use (1e9) expression OR pow() function
    --> Always direct write number as it is (like 1000000000, 1000000000+7,.......)


2) If you want to half the size of array whom you are trying to find all subsets possible
    --> Use "Meet in the middle algorithm"


3) If you are given problem realted to 'finding all unique subsequences':
    --> Think of using cache where "cache[i] = (2*cache[i-1]) - duplicates"
        i.e., at each index, you will fimd all possible subsequences using prev_index's all subsequences, then from that we will remove the duplicates
