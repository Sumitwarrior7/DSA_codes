1) Whever you have a problem related to queries in which there are starting & ending points
    ---> Try to relate it with subarray
        ---> Then try to relate it with Prefix Sum 

2) When some intervals are given in the form (l, r) and you have to figure out some expression
    --> Try Sweep-Line algorithm

3) If 'palindrome' based problem comes
    --> Think of matching string with reversed string 
    --> Think of taking mid as starting point for palindrome 
            --> simultaneously go left and right, and if both are equal->repeat the step
            --> check for both odd sized and even sized palindromes
    --> Think of DP
